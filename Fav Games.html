<br/>
<h2> Top 5 Video Games according to King Way</h2>

<hr >

<h3>#5: Naruto Shippuden: Shinobi Striker 3 & 4</h3>
<p>Because I grew up watching the anime, it was nice to have a game to relate to the story</p>
<p> Great for people the liked the anime series.</p>

<br /> 

<h3>#4: Fable 3 & 4</h3>
<p>This game has a deep story with deep charecter development</p>
<p>It's easy to get lost with so much going on in the game</p> 

<br />

<h3>#3: Grand Theft Auto / Red Dead Redemption (The series)</h3> 
<p>These games are so imersive, it is difficult to remember that you have a life sometimes.</p>
<p>Deep story, realism, interactive NPCs and more! Don't get lost in the cityscape.</p> 

<br /> 

<h3>#2: Age of Empires III & IV</h3>
<p>I am a big fan of stratagy games. I've always loved playing Risk but always found it slow. THis game is a good medium for those that love stratagy games.</p>
<p>Thes game will make you think of how to conquer and maintain your empire at the same time. Warhammer III is a bit more detailed and shares this spot as well</p>

<br />

<h3>#1: Battlefield BC 2 Battlefield 3 & 4</h3>
<p>A good mix of realism and arcade. A series of fun multiplayer shooters that are always packed with action and surising moments. Objective based games that require wit and mindful movements</p>
<p>If you are looking for more realism but massive multiplayer lobbies, Squad is a great option as well. Insurgency Sandstorm is for hardcore realists that prefer infantry heavy games.</p>

<br />

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I like action and violence. I think this list shows that but I am a lover of variety. </p>
